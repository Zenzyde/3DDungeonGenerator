# 3DDungeonGenerator
A version 2.0 of my bachelor's degree project. Based on the idea of procedurally generating a 3-dimensional (2D-plane + height) dungeon using a modified version of TinyKeep's dungeon generation algorithm.

The zip-file contains a playable version of the generator, ready for exploration! (keep in mind, it might take close to a minute for it to load)

Provided is also a unitypackage with what should be all needed files to run and test this project.

Any models, materials or textures are not made by me.

The previous version of this project (which resulted in my bacherlor's degree in game programming)
 can be found in this repository.
